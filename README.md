## ✨ Features

- **Customizable Search Bar**: Located at the bottom-right of the screen, it allows users to set custom commands (e.g., typing "news" redirects to bbc.com).
  <br><br>
- **Custom Taskbar, FolderBar, TimeBar, and Start Menu**: Docked at the bottom of the screen, the custom taskbar provides a cleaner and more organized desktop.
  <br><br>

  <br><br>
- **Custom Backgrounds**: Users can set a custom webpage or HTML site as their desktop background or select a video as wallpaper.

- **Website Widget**: A widget in the top corner provides quick access to any website (e.g., news) directly from the desktop, eliminating the need to open additional applications.
  <br><br>
- **Desktop Pet**: An animated pet duck walks on your desktop screen to accompany you.
